      # TODO: Replace with Kubernetes Job approach
      # The test runner image is already built (see merge-staging-build-test-image.yml)
      # Next step: deploy a Job in the staging cluster instead of running from GitHub Actions runner
      # Benefits: tests run inside the cluster network, closer to real conditions
